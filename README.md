# Customer-Feedback-Based-on-Facial-Expression
This repository contains the implementation of a facial expression-based emotion feedback collection system, designed to enhance customer service by capturing and analyzing real-time emotional responses. The system uses the FER-2013 dataset to train a deep learning model based on the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, capable of classifying emotions into seven categories: Happy, Neutral, Sad, Disgusted, Surprised, Fearful, and Angry.This paper was published in the proceedings of the IEEE 3rd International Conference on Innovations in Technology (INOCON) 2024

Features:

Real-Time Emotion Detection: Utilizes a Caffe Model face detector to capture and analyze facial expressions in real-time.

Emotion-Based Feedback: Displays the detected emotion and corresponding rating on a user-friendly web interface.

Feedback Logging: Stores customer feedback as a log file, including date, time, detected emotion, and rating, once submitted.

Applications: Potential use cases include telerehabilitation, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and customer feedback systems.
